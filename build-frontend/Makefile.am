## file       build-frontend/Makefile.am 


## ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS contains options to pass to aclocal when aclocal.m4
## is to be rebuilt by make. This line is also used by autoreconf to
## run aclocal with suitable options, or by autopoint and gettextize
## to locate the place where Gettext's macros should be installed. So
## even if you do not really care about the rebuild rules, you should
## define ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS.
## For some reason this can't be moved to common.am.
