------------------- Released version 1.1 -----------------------------

- Rewind, a new event-trace recording mode for long-running
  experiments, triggered by user-instrumentation macros. Writes
  semantics information in OTF2 anchor file as rewind might affect
  analysis.
- ARM support (detection + compiler adapter).
- Metric service improvements. Support for per-process metrics and
  per-system-tree-class metrics.
- Support for OpenMP-task profiling and tracing alongside with
  improvements of the POMP adapter.
- Component separation: Score-P can now use pre-installed OTF2,
  OPARI2, and CUBE packages instead of the internal ones.
  - Removed dependency to external repository that was used by
    Score-P, OTF2, and OPARI2 in order to prevent version conflicts.
- Support for CUDA profiling and tracing.
- Easier experiment configuration via scorep-info which porvides a
  list of all measurement configuration variables.
- scorep-info also provides the improved configure-summary of the
  installation.
- Scoring of profile experiments via scorep-score (if configured with
  external CUBE) to prepare a filter for subsequent trace experiment.
- Documentation improvements.
- Numereous configure improvements. Let external libraries use
  generic configure options (tbc). Fixed portability issues.
- Numerous instrumenter improvements. All possible combinations of
  options supported.
- MPI profiling improvements.
- OpenMP nesting supported altough little tested.
- Several compiler-dependent OpenMP-related bugfixes.

------------------- Released version 1.0.2 ---------------------------

- Several instrumentation fixes:
  - Improvements for PDT Fortran instrumentation.
  - Improvements for C++ user instrumentation.
  - Return real failure if instrumentation is erroneous. Failures may
    went undetected previously.
  - Allow for out-of-place builds.
  - Provide correct parameter to SCOREP_USER_REGION_ENTER macro.

- Provide correct timestamp to OmpTaskCreate events.

- Fix invalid order of arguments provided to MpiCollectiveEnd events.

- Fix bug in parameter profiling.

- Enable SIONlib support, currently just for MPI applications. 

- Various fixes for the generated OpenMP region names:
  - Inner and outer blocks got different names.
  - Regions with the ordered clause got a special name.
  - All region names got it '@file:lno' appended, to make them distinguishable.

------------------- Released version 1.0.1 ---------------------------

- Renaming of the configure related variable LD_FLAGS_FOR_BUILD to
  LDFLAGS_FOR_BUILD for consistency.

- Renaming of installed tool and options for consistency, i.e.
  changing underscores to dashes. Also, the --(no)openmp_support
  option changed to --(no)openmp.

- Improved linking on AIX systems.

- Robustness improvements when instrumenting with PDT.

- On x86 platforms, be more cautious using the tsc counter. If
  /proc/cpuinfo reports constant_tsc but not nonstop_tsc, then it is
  likely that the counter is unreliable.

- Improved configure summary.

- configure will not fail if -q or --silent is passed.
