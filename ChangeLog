------------------- Released version 1.0.2 ---------------------------

- Several instrumentation fixes:
  - Improvements for PDT Fortran instrumentation.
  - Improvements for C++ user instrumentation.
  - Return real failure if instrumentation is erroneous. Failures may
    went undetected previously.
  - Allow for out-of-place builds.
  - Provide correct parameter to SCOREP_USER_REGION_ENTER macro.

- Provide correct timestamp to OmpTaskCreate events.

- Fix invalid order of arguments provided to MpiCollectiveEnd events.

- Fix bug in parameter profiling.

- Enable SIONlib support, currently just for MPI applications. 

------------------- Released version 1.0.1 ---------------------------

- Renaming of the configure related variable LD_FLAGS_FOR_BUILD to
  LDFLAGS_FOR_BUILD for consistency.

- Renaming of installed tool and options for consistency, i.e.
  changing underscores to dashes. Also, the --(no)openmp_support
  option changed to --(no)openmp.

- Improved linking on AIX systems.

- Robustness improvements when instrumenting with PDT.

- On x86 platforms, be more cautious using the tsc counter. If
  /proc/cpuinfo reports constant_tsc but not nonstop_tsc, then it is
  likely that the counter is unreliable.

- Improved configure summary.

- configure will not fail if -q or --silent is passed.
