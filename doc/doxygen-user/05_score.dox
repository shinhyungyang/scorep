/** @page score Usage of scorep-score
@seclabel{score}

scorep-score is a tool that allows to estimate the size of an OTF2 trace
from a CUBE4 profile. Furthermore, the effects of
filters are estimated. The main goal is to define appropriate filters for
a tracing run from a profile.

The general work-flow for performance analysis with @scorep is:
<ol>
  <li> Instrument an application (see Section @secref{instrumentation}).</li>
  <li> Perform a measurement run and record a profile (see Section @secref{measurement}).
       The profile already
       gives an overview what may happen inside the application. </li>
  <li> Use scorep-score to define an appropriate filter for an application
       Otherwise the trace file may become too large. This step is explained
       in this Chapter.</li>
  <li> Perform a measurement run with tracing enabled and the filter
       applied (see Section @secref{tracing} and Section @secref{filtering}). </li>
  <li> Perform in-depth analysis on the trace data.</li>
</ol>

@section score_basic_usage Basic usage

To invoke @verb{scorep-score} you must provide the filename of a CUBE4 profile as
argument. Thus, the basic command looks like this:

@verbatim
scorep-score profile.cubex
@endverbatim

The output of the command may look like this (taking an MPI/OpenMP hybrid
application as an example):

@verbatim
Estimated aggregate size of event trace:                   20MB
Estimated requirements for largest trace buffer (max_buf): 20MB
Estimated memory requirements (SCOREP_TOTAL_MEMORY):       24MB
(hint: When tracing set SCOREP_TOTAL_MEMORY=24MB to avoid intermediate flushes
 or reduce requirements using USR regions filters.)

flt type      max_buf[B]        visits      time[s]  time[%]  time/visit[us]  region
     ALL      19,377,048       786,577        27.48    100.0           34.93  ALL
     USR      16,039,680       668,320         0.36      1.3            0.53  USR
     OMP       3,328,344       117,881        26.92     98.0          228.37  OMP
     COM           9,024           376         0.20      0.7          532.17  COM
@endverbatim

The first line of the output gives an estimation of the total size of the trace,
aggregated over all processes. This information is useful for estimating the space
required on disk. In the given example, the estimated total size of the event
trace is 20MB.

The second line prints an estimation of the memory space required
by a single process for the trace. The memory space that @scorep reserves on each process
at application start must be large enough to hold the process' trace in memory
in order to avoid flushes during runtime, because flushes heavily disturb
measurements. In addition to the trace, Score-P requires some additinal memory to
maintain internal data structures. Thus, it provides also an estimation for the
total amount of required memory on each process. The memory size per process that 
@scorep reserves is set via the environment variable @confvar{SCOREP_TOTAL_MEMORY}. 
In the given example the per process memory should be larger than 24MB.

Beginning with the 6th line, @verb{scorep-score} prints a table that show
how the trace memory requirements and the runtime is distributed among certain function
groups. The column @verb{max_tbc} shows how much trace buffer is needed
on a single process. The column @verb{time(s)} shows how much execution time was spend
in regions of that group in seconds, the column @verb{%} shows the fraction of the overall
runtime that was used by this group, and the column @verb{time/visit(us)} shows the
average time per visit in microseconds.

The following groups exist:
<ul>
 <li> ALL:   Includes all functions of the application </li>
 <li> OMP:   This group contains all regions that represent an OpenMP construct </li>
 <li> MPI:   This group contains all MPI functions </li>
 <li> SHMEM: This group contains all SHMEM functions </li>
 <li> COM:   This group contains all functions, implemented by the user that appear on
             a call-path to an OpenMP construct, or MPI/SHMEM function.</li>
 <li> USR:   This group contains all user functions that do not appear on a call-path to
             an OpenMP construct, or MPI/SHMEM function. </li>
</ul>

@section score_region_output Additional per-region information

For a more detailed output, which shows the data for every region, you can use the
@verb{-r} option. The command could look like this.

@verbatim
scorep-score profile.cubex -r
@endverbatim

This command adds information about the used buffer sizes and execution time of every
region to the table. The additional lines of the output may look like this:

@verbatim
flt type      max_buf[B]        visits      time[s]  time[%]  time/visit[us]  region

     COM              24             4         0.00      0.0           67.78  Init

     USR              24             4         0.00      0.0           23.76  PrintResults
     COM              24             4         0.01      0.2         3441.83  Finish
     COM              24             4         0.48      7.7       120338.17  Jacobi
@endverbatim

The region name is displayed in the column named @verb{region}.
The column @verb{type} shows to which group this region belongs.
In the example above the function main belongs to group @verb{COM}
required 24 bytes per process and used 0 s execution time. The
regions are sorted by their buffer requirements.

@section scorep_filter Defining and testing a filter
@seclabel{scorep_filter}
For defining a filter, it is recommended to exclude short frequently called
functions from measurement, because they require a lot of
buffer space (represented by a high value under @verb{max_tbc}) but incur a high
measurement overhead. Furthermore, for communication analysis, functions
that appear on a call-path to MPI functions and OpenMP constructs (regions
of type @verb{COM}) are usually of more interest than user functions of type @verb{USR}
which do not appear on call-path to communications. MPI functions and OpenMP
constructs cannot be filtered. Thus, it is usually a good approach to exclude
regions of type @verb{USR} starting at the top of the list until you reduced the trace
to your needs. Section @secref{filtering} describes the format of a filter
specification file.

If you have a filter file, you can test the effect of your filter on the trace file.
Therefor, you need to pass a @verb{-f} followed by the file name of your filter. E.g.
if your filter file name is @verb{myfilter}, the command looks like this:

@verbatim
scorep-score profile.cubex -f myfilter
@endverbatim

An example output is:

@verbatim
Estimated aggregate size of event trace:                   7kB
Estimated requirements for largest trace buffer (max_buf): 1806 bytes
Estimated memory requirements (SCOREP_TOTAL_MEMORY):       5MB
(hint: When tracing set SCOREP_TOTAL_MEMORY=5MB to avoid intermediate flushes
 or reduce requirements using USR regions filters.)

flt type      max_buf[B]        visits      time[s]  time[%]  time/visit[us]  region

 -   MPI           1,805           124         4.20     81.3        33910.31  MPI-FLT

@endverbatim

Now, the output estimates the total trace size an the required memory per process,
if you would apply the provided filter for the measurement run which records the
trace. A new group @verb{FLT} appears, which contains all regions that
are filtered. Under @verb{max_tbc} the group @verb{FLT} displays how the memory
requirements per process are reduced. Furthermore, the groups that end
on @verb{-FLT}, like @verb{ALL-FLT} contain only the unfiltered regions of the
original group. E.g. @verb{USR-FLT} contains all regions of group @verb{USR} that
are not filtered.

Furthermore, the column @verb{flt} is no longer empty but contain a symbol that
indicates how this group is affected by the filter. A '@verb{-}'
means 'not filtered', a '@verb{+}' means 'filtered' and a '@verb{*}' appears in front
of groups that potentially can be affected by the filter.

You may combine the @verb{-f} option with a @verb{-r} option. In this case, for each
function a '@verb{+}' or '@verb{-}' indicates whether the function is filtered.

@section score_metrics Calculating the effects of recording hardware counters

Recording additional metrics, e.g. hardware counters may significantly increase
the trace size, because for many events additional metric values
are stored. In order to estimate the effects of these metrics, you may add
a @verb{-c} followed by the number of metrics you want to record. E.g.

@verbatim
scorep-score profile.cubex -c 3
@endverbatim

would mean that @verb{scorep-score} estimates the disk and memory requirements
for the case that you record 3 additional metrics.
