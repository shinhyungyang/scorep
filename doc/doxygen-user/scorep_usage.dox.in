This is the Score-P instrumentation tool. The usage is:
scorep <options> <original command>

Common options are:
  --help, -h      Show help output. Does not execute any other command.
  --config=<file> Specifies file for the instrumentation configuration.
  -v, --verbose[=<value>] Specifies the verbosity level. The following
                  levels are available:
                  0 = No output
                  1 = Executed commands are displayed (default if no
                      value is specified)
                  2 = Detailed information is displayed
  --dry-run       Only displays the executed commands. It does not
                  execute any command.
  --keep-files    Do not delete temporarily created files after successful
                  instrumentation. By default, temporary files are deleted
                  if no error occurs during instrumentation.
  --instrument-filter=<file>
                  Specifies the filter file for filtering functions during
                  compile-time. Not supported by all instrumentation methods.
                  It applies the same syntax, as the one used by Score-P during
                  run-time.
  --version       Prints the Score-P version and exits.
  --static        Enforce static linking of the Score-P libraries.
  --dynamic       Enforce dynamic linking of the Score-P libraries.
  --no-as-needed  Adds a GNU ld linker flag to fix undefined references
                  when using shared Score-P libraries. This happens on
                  systems using --as-needed as linker default. It will
                  be handled transparently in future releases of Score-P.
  --thread=<paradigm>[:<variant>]
                  Possible paradigms and variants are:
              none
                  No thread support.
              omp:pomp_tpd
                  OpenMP support using OPARI2 thread tracking.
                  It requires and, thus, automatically enables OPARI2
                  instrumentation.
              omp:ancestry
                  OpenMP support using thread tracking with ancestry functions
                  in OpenMP 3.0 and later.
                  It requires and, thus, automatically enables OPARI2
                  instrumentation.
              pthread
                  Pthread support using thread tracking via library wrapping
                  It conflicts and, thus, automatically disables OPARI2
                  instrumentation.
  --mpp=<paradigm>[:<variant>]
                  Possible paradigms and variants are:
              none
                  No multi-process support.
              mpi
                  MPI support using library wrapping
              shmem
                  SHMEM support using library wrapping
  --mutex=<paradigm>[:<variant>]
                  Possible paradigms and variants are:
              none
                  serial case, no locking
              pthread
                  Pthread mutex locks
              pthread:spinlock
                  Pthread spinlocks
              omp
                  OpenMP locks
  --compiler      Enables compiler instrumentation.
                  By default, it disables pdt instrumentation.
  --nocompiler    Disables compiler instrumentation.
  --cuda          Enables cuda instrumentation.
  --nocuda        Disables cuda instrumentation.
  --online-access Enables online-access support. It is disabled by default
  --noonline-access Disables online-access support.
  --pomp          Enables pomp user instrumentation. By default, it also
                  enables preprocessing.
  --nopomp        Disables pomp user instrumentation. (Default)
  --openmp        Enables instrumentation of OpenMP directives. By default,
                  it also enables preprocessing. (Default for compile units
                  with enabled OpenMP support during the compilation)
  --noopenmp      Disables instrumentation of OpenMP directives.
                  Note: To ensure thread-safe execution of the measurement,
                  parallel regions still need to be tracked and will appear
                  in the results. (Default for compile units without OpenMP
                  enabled compilation)
  --opari=<parameter-list>
                  Pass options to the source-to-source instrumenter OPARI2
                  to have finer control over the instrumentation process.
                  Please refer to the OPARI2 user documentation for more
                  details.
  --pdt[=<parameter-list>]
                  Enables pdt instrumentation.
                  You may add additional parameters that are passed to pdt.
                  It requires and, thus, automatically enables user
                  instrumentation.
                  It conflicts and, thus, automatically disables preprocess
                  instrumentation.
                  By default, it disables compiler instrumentation.
  --nopdt         Disables pdt instrumentation.
  --preprocess    Enables preprocess instrumentation.
                  It cannot be enabled, if not at least one of the following is
                  enabled: OPARI2 instrumentation.
                  It conflicts and, thus, automatically disables pdt
                  instrumentation.
  --nopreprocess  Disables preprocess instrumentation.
  --user          Enables user instrumentation.
  --nouser        Disables user instrumentation.
  --opencl        Enables OpenCL instrumentation.
  --noopencl      Disables OpenCL instrumentation.
  --openacc       Enables OpenACC instrumentation.
  --noopenacc     Disables OpenACC instrumentation.
  --memory        Enables memory usage instrumentation. It is enabled by default.
  --nomemory      Disables memory usage instrumentation.
