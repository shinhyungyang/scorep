scorep <options> <orginal command>

Common options are:
  --help, -h      Show help output. Does not execute any other command.
  --config=<file> Specifies file for the instrumentation configuration.
  -v, --verbose[=<value>] Specifies the verbosity level. The following
                  levels are available:
                  0 = No output
                  1 = Executed commands are displayed (default if no
                      value is specified)
                  2 = Detailed information is displayed
  --dry-run       Only displays the executed commands. It does not
                  execute any command.
  --keep-files    Do not delete temporarily created files after successfull
                  instrumentation. By default, temporary files are deleted
                  if no error occures during instrumentation.
  --version       Prints the Score-P version and exits.
  --compiler      Enables compiler instrumentation. Is enabled by default.
  --nocompiler    Disables compiler instrumentation.
  --mpi           Enables mpi wrapper. They are enabled by default if it is an
                  mpi program.
  --nompi         Disables mpi wrappers. They are disabled by default if
                  it is no mpi program.
  --opari         Enables Opari instrumentation. Is enabled by default
