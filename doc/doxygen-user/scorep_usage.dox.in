This is the SCOREP instrumentation tool. The usage is:
scorep <options> <orginal command>

Common options are:
  --help, -h      Show help output. Does not execute any other command.
  --config=<file> Specifies file for the instrumentation configuration.
  -v, --verbose[=<value>] Specifies the verbosity level. The following
                  levels are available:
                  0 = No output
                  1 = Executed commands are displayed (default if no
                      value is specified)
                  2 = Detailed information is displayed
  --dry-run       Only displays the executed commands. It does not
                  execute any command.
  --keep-files    Do not delete temporarily created files after successfull
                  instrumentation. By default, temporary files are deleted
                  if no error occures during instrumentation.
  --version       Prints the Score-P version and exits.
  --mpi           Enables mpi wrapper. They are enabled by default if it is an
                  mpi program.
  --nompi         Disables mpi wrappers. They are disabled by default if
                  it is no mpi program.
  --openmp        Enables OpenMP support. Needed if the instrumentation
                  does not correctly identify your application as OpenMP
                  program.
  --noopenmp      Disables OpenMP support.
  --no-as-needed  Adds a GNU ld linker flag to fix undefined references
                  when using shared scorep libraries. This happens on
                  systems using --as-needed as linker default. It will
                  be handled transparently in future releases of scorep.
  --nocobi        Disables cobi instrumentation.
  --compiler      Enables compiler instrumentation.
                  By default, it disables cobi and pdt instrumentation.
  --nocompiler    Disables compiler instrumentation.
  --nocuda        Disables cuda instrumentation.
  --pomp[=<paramter-list>]
                  Enables pomp user instrumentation.
                  You may add additional parameters that are passed to OPARI2.
                  By default, it enables also preprocessing
  --nopomp        Disables pomp user instrumentation.
  --opari[=<paramter-list>]
                  Enables OPARI2 instrumentation of OpenMP regions.
                  You may add additional parameters that are passed to OPARI2
                  By default, it enables also preprocessing and
                  pomp user instrumentation.
  --pdt[=<paramter-list>]
                  Enables pdt instrumentation.
                  You may add additional parameters that are passed to pdt.
                  It requires and, thus, automatically enables user instrumentation.
                  It conflicts and, thus, automatically disables preprocess instrumentation.
                  By default, it disables cobi and compiler instrumentation.
  --nopdt         Disables pdt instrumentation.
  --preprocess    Enables preprocess instrumentation.
                  It conflicts and, thus, automatically disables pdt instrumentation.
  --nopreprocess  Disables preprocess instrumentation.
  --user          Enables user instrumentation.
  --nouser        Disables user instrumentation.
