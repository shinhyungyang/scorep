This is the SCOREP user tool. The usage is:
scorep <options> <orginal command>

Common options are:
  --help, -h      Show help output. Does not execute any other command.
  --config=<file> Specifies file for the instrumentation configuration.
  -v, --verbose[=<value>] Specifies the verbosity level. The following
                  levels are available:
                  0 = No output
                  1 = Executed commands are displayed (default if no
                      value is specified)
                  2 = Detailed information is displayed
  --dry-run       Only displays the executed commands. It does not
                  execute any command.
  --keep-files    Do not delete temporarily created files after successfull
                  instrumentation. By default, temporary files are deleted
                  if no error occures during instrumentation.
  --version       Prints the Score-P version and exits.
  --compiler      Enables compiler instrumentation. Is enabled by default.
  --nocompiler    Disables compiler instrumentation.
  --mpi           Enables mpi wrapper. They are enabled by default if it is an
                  mpi program.
  --nompi         Disables mpi wrappers. They are disabled by default if
                  it is no mpi program.
  --opari[="<parameter-list>"] Enables Opari2 instrumentation. Is enabled by default
                  if it is an OpenMP program.
                  You may specify additional parameters that are passed to Opari2.
  --pomp          Enables semi-automatic pomp user instrumentation.
                  By default, it is enabled if OPARI2 instrumentation is
                  enabled.
  --nopomp        Disables semi-automatic pomp user instrumentation.
                  By default, it is enabled if OPARI2 instrumentation is
                  enabled.
  --user          Enables manual user instrumentation.
  --nouser        Disables manual user instrumentation. Is disabled by default.
  --pdt[="<parameter-list>"] Enables source code instrumentation with PDT using
                  the TAU instrumentor.
                  It will automatically enable the user instrumentation
                  and disable compiler instrumentation.
                  You may specify additional parameters that are passed
                  to the TAU instrumentor.
  --nopdt         Disables the source code instrumentation with PDT.
                  It is disabled by default.
  --cobi[=\"<parameter-list>\"] Enables binary instrumentation with Cobi.
                  Disables compiler instrumentation.
                  You may specify additional parameters that are passed to Cobi.
  --nocobi        Disables the binary instrumentation with Cobi.
                  It is disabled by default.
  --openmp        Enables OpenMP support. Needed if the instrumentation
                  does not correctly identify your application as OpenMP
                  program.
  --noopenmp      Disables OpenMP support.
  --static        Enforce static linking of the Score-P libraries.
  --dynamic       Enforce dynamic linking of the Score-P libraries.
