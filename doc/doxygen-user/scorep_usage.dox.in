This is the Score-P instrumentation tool. The usage is:
scorep <options> <original command>

Common options are:
  --help, -h      Show help output. Does not execute any other command.
  -v, --verbose[=<value>] Specifies the verbosity level. The following
                  levels are available:
                  0 = No output
                  1 = Executed commands are displayed (default if no
                      value is specified)
                  2 = Detailed information is displayed
  --dry-run       Only displays the executed commands. It does not
                  execute any command.
  --keep-files    Do not delete temporarily created files after successful
                  instrumentation. By default, temporary files are deleted
                  if no error occurs during instrumentation.
  --instrument-filter=<file>
                  Specifies the filter file for filtering functions during
                  compile-time. Not supported by all instrumentation methods.
                  It applies the same syntax, as the one used by Score-P during
                  run-time.
  --version       Prints the Score-P version and exits.
  --disable-preprocessing
                  Tells scorep to skip all preprocessing related steps,
                  the input files are already preprocessed.
  --no-as-needed  Adds a GNU ld linker flag to fix undefined references
                  when using shared Score-P libraries. This happens on
                  systems using --as-needed as linker default. It will
                  be handled transparently in future releases of Score-P.
  --thread=<paradigm>[:<variant>]
                  Possible paradigms and variants are:
              none
                  No thread support.
              omp:opari2
                  OpenMP support using thread tracking via ancestry functions
                  in OpenMP 3.0 and later.
                  It requires and, thus, automatically enables OPARI2
                  instrumentation.
              omp:ompt
                  OpenMP support using thread tracking via OMPT.
              pthread
                  Pthread support.
                  It conflicts and, thus, automatically disables OPARI2
                  instrumentation.
  --mpp=<paradigm>[:<variant>]
                  Possible paradigms and variants are:
              none
                  No multi-process support.
              mpi
                  MPI support using library wrapping
              shmem
                  SHMEM support using library wrapping
  --io=<paradigm>[:<variant>](,<paradigm>[:<variant>])*
                  The default is the first supported mode in the above order.
                  Possible paradigms and variants are:
              none
                  No I/O wrapping support.
              posix
                  POSIX I/O support using library wrapping. This includes the
                  file descriptor based POSIX API (i.e., `open`/`close`). The
                  POSIX asynchronous I/O API (i.e., `aio_read`/`aio_write`), if
                  available. And the ISO C `FILE` handle based API (i.e.,
                  `fopen`/`fclose`).
  --compiler      Enables compiler instrumentation.
  --nocompiler    Disables compiler instrumentation.
  --cuda          Enables CUDA instrumentation. Enabled by default, if the
                  nvcc compiler is in use. In this case it also conflicts and
                  thus automatically disables preprocessing.
  --nocuda        Disables CUDA instrumentation.
  --pomp          Deprecated, consider using manual region instrumentation (--user)
                  instead. Enables OPARI2 pomp user instrumentation. By default, it
                  also enables preprocessing.
  --nopomp        Deprecated, consider using manual region instrumentation (--user)
                  instead. Disables OPARI2 pomp user instrumentation (Default).
  --openmp        Deprecated, please use --thread=omp:opari2 instead.
                  Enables OPARI2 instrumentation of OpenMP directives. By default,
                  it also enables preprocessing (Default for compile units
                  with enabled OpenMP support during the compilation).
                  Conflicts with --thread=omp:ompt.
  --noopenmp      Deprecated, please use --thread=none instead.
                  Disables OPARI2 instrumentation of OpenMP directives.
                  Note: To ensure thread-safe execution of the measurement,
                  parallel regions still need to be tracked and will appear
                  in the results (Default for compile units without OpenMP
                  enabled compilation).
  --opari=<parameter-list>
                  Pass options to the source-to-source instrumenter OPARI2
                  to have finer control over the instrumentation process.
                  Please refer to the OPARI2 user documentation for more
                  details.
  --preprocess    Enables preprocess instrumentation.
                  It cannot be enabled, if not at least one of the following is
                  enabled: OPARI2 instrumentation.
  --nopreprocess  Disables preprocess instrumentation.
  --user          Enables user instrumentation.
  --nouser        Disables user instrumentation.
  --opencl[:<wrap-mode>]
                  Enables OpenCL instrumentation.
  --noopencl      Disables OpenCL instrumentation.
  --openacc       Enables OpenACC instrumentation.
  --noopenacc     Disables OpenACC instrumentation.
  --memory        Enables memory usage instrumentation. It is enabled by default.
  --nomemory      Disables memory usage instrumentation.
  --libwrap=(<wrapper-name>...|<path-to-wrapper>)
                  Enables user library wrapping for specified libraries.
                  <wrapper-name>... is a comma-separated list of library wrappers
                  which will be looked up in the paths of the colon-separated
                  'SCOREP_LIBWRAP_PATH' environment variable and in the installation
                  directory of Score-P. <path-to-wrapper> is a full path to the
                  .libwrap anchor file.
                  Use 'scorep-info libwrap-summary' for a more detailed listing
                  of available library wrappers.
  --kokkos        Enables Kokkos instrumentation.
  --nokokkos      Disables Kokkos instrumentation.
  --hip           Enables HIP instrumentation. Enabled by default, if the
                  hipcc compiler is in use. In this case it also disables by
                  default the compiler instrumentation and conflicts with the
                  preprocessing.
  --nohip         Disables HIP instrumentation.
